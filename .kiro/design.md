# Motion & Accessibility

## Motion Guidelines

- Hero reveal: One orchestrated animation on page load (level-up path draws in, patterns cycle start)
- Micro-interactions: Hover (scale, shadow lift), press (slight scale-down + color shift), focus (focus ring)
- Avoid: Scattered animations, parallax, auto-playing video, infinite loops
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion: Replace all animations with instant transitions (0s duration) or reduced opacity changes

## Focus States

- All interactive elements: Visible 2–3px focus ring (use Marigold or Ink Navy depending on background)
- Keyboard navigation: Tab order logical, skip-to-main-content link (optional but recommended)
- Touch targets: Minimum 44×44px

# Copy Guidelines

- Tone: Friendly, encouraging, clear
- Case: Sentence case everywhere (no ALL CAPS titles, no Title Case button labels)
- Punctuation: No exclamation marks in system copy (buttons, status messages)
- Example: "Start practicing" not "START PRACTICING!" or "Start Practicing"
